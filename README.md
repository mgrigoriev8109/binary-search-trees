This is a Binary Search Tree I created using Ruby.

You can have a look at it running through most of the methods on a test array [by clicking here](https://replit.com/@mgrig92/binary-search-trees#.replit).

This was a very long, but fun project to work through. I truly feel like I've gotten a much better understanding of recursion, scope, and am beginning to understand the value of data structures such as Binary Search Trees.
